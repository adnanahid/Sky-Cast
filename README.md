## API Integration

This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.

## API Endpoint Used

    https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric
    https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={latitude}&lon={longitude}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric

- Replace {city} with the user's search query.
- Replace {latitude} from users geoLocation.
- Replace {longitude} from users geoLocation.
- Replace {API_KEY} with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

## Design Choice

I love creating simple and clean applications, so I focus on keeping the UI minimal and clutter-free. This is primarily a one-page app, where the home page layout is designed for easy access to essential information.

At the top, I placed the app logo on the left and the current time on the right. Below that, the weather component takes center stage, featuring a search bar at the top for quick location-based queries.

To provide users with insightful weather details, I designed three informative cards:

- Current Weather Update ‚Äì Displays real-time weather conditions.
- Next 3-Hour Forecast ‚Äì Positioned to the right, offering a short-term weather outlook.
- Extended Forecast ‚Äì Located at the bottom, providing additional weather insights.

For real-time and accurate weather data, I chose OpenWeatherMap due to its reliability and ease of integration. The API delivers up-to-date information, which is crucial for any weather application. Additionally, its support for Celsius makes it user-friendly for a global audience, as Celsius is widely used in most parts of the world.

## Troubleshooting

### TailwindCSS Not Working?

Make sure:

- globals.css is imported in layout.tsx or \_app.tsx.
- Tailwind content paths are correctly set in tailwind.config.ts.
- Restart the Next.js server after changes.

### API Not Working?

- Check if your API key is correctly set in .env.local.
- Restart the development server.
- Ensure the OpenWeatherMap API key is valid and activated.
