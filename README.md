# üå¶ Sky Cast

#### A simple weather application built with Next.js and TypeScript that fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- **Show weather for the user's current location by default:** Upon loading the app, the weather for the user's current location is displayed automatically.
- **Search weather by city name:** Allows users to search for weather in any city by typing the name in the search bar.
- **Display current temperature:** Shows the current temperature in Celsius for the selected city or user's location.
- **Show weather conditions:** Displays detailed weather conditions like clouds, wind, humidity, etc.
- **Responsive UI:** The application is designed to work seamlessly across both desktop and mobile devices using TailwindCSS.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Next.js), TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **API:** OpenWeatherMap API

## Dependencies

    "dependencies": {
        "axios": "^1.8.2",

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/adnanahid/Sky-Cast.git
    cd Sky_Cast

### 2Ô∏è‚É£Install Dependencies

    npm install
    # or
    yarn install

### 3Ô∏è‚É£Set Up Environment Variables

    NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Development Server

    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev

## API Integration

This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.

## API Endpoint Used

    https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric
    https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={latitude}&lon={longitude}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric

- Replace {city} with the user's search query.
- Replace {latitude} from users geoLocation.
- Replace {longitude} from users geoLocation.
- Replace {API_KEY} with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

## Design Choice

The decision to use OpenWeatherMap was based on its reliability and ease of integration with real-time weather data. The API provides accurate and up-to-date information that is critical for any weather application. Additionally, the option to get data in Celsius makes it more suitable for global users, as it‚Äôs widely used in most parts of the world.

## Troubleshooting

### TailwindCSS Not Working?

Make sure:

- globals.css is imported in layout.tsx or \_app.tsx.
- Tailwind content paths are correctly set in tailwind.config.ts.
- Restart the Next.js server after changes.

### API Not Working?

- Check if your API key is correctly set in .env.local.
- Restart the development server.
- Ensure the OpenWeatherMap API key is valid and activated.
